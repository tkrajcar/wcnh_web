      Roleplaying Opportunities are the New Horizon version of Craigslist.  Maybe you're looking for a character concept to jump start your imagination.
      Or maybe you're just looking for an ongoing plot to join.  Whatever the case, the Roleplaying Opportunities list is a collection point for any and 
      all ideas related to roleplaying.  The items listed here are linked to the in-game '+rp' system, which allows players to post their ideas while 
      they're online.  Posts are categorized as follows:
    %p
      -@rpcats.each do |i|
        %strong= link_to(i.name, rp_path(:category => i.name))
        =" - #{i.desc}"
        %br
    -else
      %h3= "#{@cat.first.name} - #{@cat.first.desc}"
      %br
      -@rpitems.each do |i|
        %h4= "Post #{i.num}"
        %p
          %strong Title: 
          = "#{i.title}"
