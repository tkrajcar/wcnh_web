      %h3 The Enigma Sector
      %p WC:NH is set in the Enigma Sector, a battleworn corner of the galaxy that was mostly left to its own devices after the war's conclusion.
      %p The active governments in the sector are the <a href="/pages/enigma-sector-consortium/">Enigma Sector Consortium</a> and the <a href="/pages/kilrathi-commonwealth/">Kilrathi Commonwealth</a>; the governments have a fully reciprocal trade, diplomatic relations, and extradition treaty and have abided in peace.
      %p As a concession to playability, at our open, there are four systems with "built-out" planets: <a href="/pages/cabrea-system/">Cabrea</a>, <a href="/pages/midgard-system/">Midgard</a>, <a href="/pages/pembroke-system/">Pembroke</a>, and <a href="/pages/vespus-system/">Vespus</a>. As the game grows, we will build and populate our systems as needed.
