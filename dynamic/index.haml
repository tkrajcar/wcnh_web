          New Zurich Attack
        %p The tranquility of New Zurich was disrupted today when a lone gunman was able to bypass security procedures and transport a firearm onto the spaceport. The target of the gunman was the CEO of Brookings Developments based on Vespus. Although no one has claimed the attack statements made by the shooter would identify him as associated with the Free Enigma Movement, a fringe group of individuals against corporate profit. The shooter, who was killed by security following the attack, was identified as Peter Bolton. Security personnel are looking for any individuals with links to the attacks and information can be provided to Vespus Port Security.

          Assault on Damioyn Pirates
        %p Tachyon cannons pounded a recently discovered moon outpost in the Damioyn system today as Consortium forces eradicated what they claimed to be a pirate base. Though no journalists were allowed to photograph or film the area, audio files from eyewitnesses told the story of a brutal bombardment. Early warning radars and other scanners were the first targets, followed by power stations, docking bays, and communications arrays. There is no word at this time on the number of casualties, or if there were any survivors. Some reports say that torpedoes were launched from the north side of the moon during the assault, bringing down a Consortium cruiser, but a representative from the Enigma Board denies it and the report cannot be confirmed at this time.

No casualties were reported, but several Revilite mining drills were severely damaged. A spokesman for the Guinterin Combine reported that there is currently no timeline for when the drills will be back on line. Guinterin Combine stock has dropped several points in response.

          Arrest Made in VSI Murder Case
        %p Law officers on Sting today announced a breakthrough in the case of the murdered Vice President of Marketing of Von Sprechen Industries, Korlo Irelli. Two men - one dead and one alive - were dropped off in front of the Governor's office along with a personal digital assistant containing a signed confession to the murder. Consortium security officials on Vespus are crediting several contracted militia soldiers with solving the case. "This is proof that our contract militia system is working," said a representative of the Enigma Board.

          Kilrathi Commonwealth Ship Bombed
        %p Commonwealth forces are reeling today as a command ship, the Golden Fang, was destroyed in geosynchronous orbit over Cabrea II. Comm traffic at the time of destruction suggests the Fang was destroyed by a hydrogen bomb hidden in a supply ship's cargo payload. The ship had a crew of several hundred, none of whom are expected to have made it to escape pods after the blast. A video uploaded from the surface of Cabrea II minutes later revealed human rights activist Raylin Konig. His statement was brief: "The Enigma Sector is a human sector. Go back to Kilrah."
