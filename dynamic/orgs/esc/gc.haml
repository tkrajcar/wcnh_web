      %h3 Von Guinterin Combine

      %p The Guinterin Combine is one of the founding member corporations of the Enigma Sector Consortium. It's often referred to as the "muscle" of the Big 3 due to its role as the primary contractor of private security forces for the Consortium. The majority of the company's profits come from other large corporations that are looking for protection from pirates and other undesirables. This makes the Combine fairly unique in that its success depends not on the needs or desires of the consumer, but on the continued peace-of-mind of its own competitors.
      
      %p The Guinterin Combine is a fairly reputable business in the present-day Enigma Sector, but its history is far from legitimate. In the late 2660's, most of the criminal activity in the Gemini Sector occurred under the watchful eye of renowned mafia boss Guilermo Guinterino. Guilermo was from the old school, and firmly believed that the best way of doing things was to remain under the radar of Confederation authorities. He maintained a small and reasonably profitable racketeering operation, but never allowed his aspirations to grow beyond the borders of a few small systems in the Gemini Sector. Guilermo's only son, Paulo, had bigger dreams. Paulo saw the billions of credits in profit that corporations like Von Sprechen Industries were reporting every few months, and he wanted a piece of the pie. Paulo's attempts to expand his father's operation were met with stiff resistance and harsh rebukes. Guilermo routinely chastised his son in front of his own lieutenants. Paulo's embarrassment and anger resulted in a gradually widening rift that developed between father and son.

      %p Paulo finally reached his breaking point in 2669. With one ship and a handful of loyal friends, he left his father and the Gemini Sector for good in order to seek his own fortune. Paulo sought fresh opportunity in the Enigma Sector, a collection of systems that was right in the middle of some of the quadrant's most profitable - and dangerous - trade routes. Paulo, now calling himself Paul, started small by necessity and used the skills he knew best. He and his cronies picked a series of remote settlements where they could move in and begin charging outrageous fees from local businesses in exchange for "protection". As the Terran-Kilrathi war escalated, it became increasingly rare for Paul's racket to garner the attention of Confederation authorities. He was left to operate fairly autonomously.

      %p Paul's operation went off without a hitch until 2671 when he tried to expand into a small settlement on the recently liberated world of Cabrea II. The location seemed prime: A world full of humans that were suddenly free from the iron grip of Kilrathi slave masters. It should have been a perfect opportunity to take advantage of disadvantaged and easily susceptible refugees. But Paul failed to anticipate the continuing conflict as Kilrathi soldiers fought to retake the planet. He found himself unceremoniously thrust into the unlikely role of a resistance fighter, using his knowledge and resources to defend freed slaves (and his own interests) from the Kilrathi Empire's invaders. The propaganda headlines wrote themselves. In a few weeks, the Guinterin Combine went from being a largely unknown backwater world criminal racket to the most prominent defender of human interests in the Enigma Sector. Those who felt abandoned by an increasingly weakened Terran Confederation found hope in the Combine. Paul was more interested in turning a profit than defending the downtrodden, but he was smart enough to see an opportunity when it presented itself. There were credits to be made with this new identity.

      %p The Kilrathi retook Cabrea II within a year, but the Guinterin Combine remained a prominent force in the Enigma Sector. As the Terran-Kilrathi war grew toward culmination, the Combine was seemingly the only organization capable of maintaining any semblance of order in the otherwise lawless sector. The Combine's brand of order was a far cry from the Terran Confederation's, but they managed to get the job done more often than not. When the Taffin Reclamation and Von Sprechen Industries expressed an interest in purchasing Vespus I, Paul was naturally positioned to become the third partner. 

      %p The Guinterin Combine has maintained its role as the enforcer of the Big 3 in the decades since the signing of the Enigma Accords. Most official Consortium military operations are managed entirely by the Combine's executive board. Their private security forces maintain a strong presence on the core worlds of the sector, but they have found it increasingly difficult to keep order in the more distant systems. In recent years, the Combine has started offering peacekeeper contracts to private citizens in outlying systems, effectively deputizing them to enforce Consortium law. The effort has had mixed results, and corruption runs rampant in many areas.

      %p Paul Guinterino had several children and has long since retired, but none of his children inherited his title of CEO. Paul abhorred the concept of a family-run corporation because of his own upbringing, and staunchly believed that fresh minds inevitably lead to fresh ideas and greater profits. Unfortunately, Paul's retirement has left the Combine without strong leadership in recent years. A dozen executives continually battle for control of the company, and media efforts to downplay the power struggle are only moderately successful.
